      <title>Can Conductor handle high-velocity stream data?</title>
      <link>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question65/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question65/</guid>
      <description>In its original incarnation, Conductor can support only low velocity stream data via an API. The majority of current edition solutions use poll-type patterns for ingesting data. The roadmap for the next 6 months includes support for stream-based data patterns, and customers notified of this when available for early-access or general availability. We are always happy to aid any development efforts, so please let us know if we can help.</description>

      <title>Can I authenticate with Conductor via my own Identity Provider? </title>
      <link>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question68/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question68/</guid>
      <description>Yes! Conductor supports a Bring-Your-Own-IdP model, meaning we will help you integrate an enterprise identity provider (e.g. Azure AD, ADFS, GApps etc.) which you can then map to users and permissions. Until self-service options become available, the easiest way to get started with this is to raise a support case, and we can help you from there. Until an IdP is configured, local credentials can be issued via the platform for you and your users.</description>

      <description>Conductor supports exporting all Organisational data via JSON or CSV. This includes not only resource data, but supporting information around resource groups, solutions and policies in place. This data can be post-processed as needed or stored for compliance reasons. The exported data format is always versioned. It should be noted that it is possible to export data returned from a query in these formats also for reporting purposes.</description>

      <title>Can I extend the Conductor UI?</title>
      <link>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question64/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question64/</guid>
      <description>Solutions are used to extend functionality in Conductor and can make use of available UI components. As of the present, these components are developed as part of the core platform and whilst can be leveraged by developed solutions, are unable to themselves be extended by developers. If this is a requirement, please get in touch.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question58/</guid>
      <description>Conductor provides some solutions which happen to include automatic remediation for some cases. These are heavily dependent on the solutions themselves, and users are able to easily extend them as required to meet a broad range of requirements. Cloudreach offers service support contracts for AWS, Azure and GCP hosted applications and infrastructure via a their Cloud Core offering which includes use of Conductor. Please get in touch for more information if this is of interest.</description>

      <title>Conductor mentions queries a lot, does this use a defined query syntax?</title>
      <link>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question61/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question61/</guid>
      <description>We use a modified version of Apache Lucene for our query syntax. This was chosen due to its industry reputation and prevalence. At this time Conductor does not support the full specification for Lucene (reference here), but will continue to evolve over time, directed by market demand. If a particular capability is missing which you would like to see included, please get in touch.</description>

      <description>Establish the link between your service portfolios, data sets and cloud infrastructure. Conductor allows insight not just into what a particular resource is, but HOW it relates to other resources and what the impact of that relationship is. Understand what the critical chain looks like for you and your stakeholders as well as what happens when a link in the chain is compromised. Using out of the box solutions or the solution SDK, enable or develop measures to increase operational integrity and insight.</description>

      <description>Resources are point-in-time records at the moment, meaning that any resource which is updated will lose resolution of that change. Keeping a historical record of changes in-line with a retention policy will be available in the next 6 months and allow users to see the full change log set for a given resource. Until this feature is available, it should be noted that Conductor can emit events when a resource changes, along with a record of that change.</description>

      <description>There are two aspects to developing with Conductor depending on what you need to achieve. Where an organisation may wish to integrate the Conductor platform, an API is made available which can be used to achieve anything possible via the WebUI or CLI. If developing new or extending existing solutions is more in-scope, the SDK and Conductor development lifecycle can be used to quickly prototype, test and deploy quality solutions into the Solution Gallery for your organisation.</description>

      <description>Conductor&amp;rsquo;s resource group model is open ended and can be used for multiple purposes, including &amp;lsquo;representation&amp;rsquo; of an application within an Organisation. Provided a query can be used to define what the application is (e.g. everything tagged application:MyApplication), then Conductor can represent this for you. This makes it easy to apply application specific policies to your applications as needed.</description>

      <description>Your storage capacity is measured every 24 hours and displayed on a per organisation basis along with the current capacity tier procured. This can be changed (up-or-down) by getting in touch with your account manager or raising a support case. In the near future this will be modifiable via the settings page of Conductor. For managed service providers using Conductor across multiple organisations, please raise a support case and we will get in touch to quota capacity across organisations you specify.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question63/</guid>
      <description>Customers’ data is separated at rest by associating all data in our database with an “Organisation” key. This is unique to a customer. Our APIs also segregate data and validate all data returned is associated to the same Organisation key. We audit our public and private APIs for compliance to this requirement with every build / release. See our privacy policy and security policy for a detailed breakdown of our respective postures.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudreach-pdev.github.io/faqs/general/question67/</guid>
      <description>Due to restrictions in place to prevent cross-organisational contamination or compromise, it is not possible to query universally across all organisations which you may be managing (under an MSP agreement with Cloudreach). It is however possible to enumerate a query across all organisations (i.e. the same query is made against all organisations) and results aggregated.</description>

      <description>The previous sections spoke about enabling solutions and using queries to group resources to build an organisational model. This section expands on these ideas and introduces how policies work in Conductor. The general policy model   With Conductor, solutions define policies and resource types (e.g. AWS EC2 instances) they apply to. Policies are associated with resources via resource groups, allowing policies to work well with highly ephemeral environments. For each type of policy enabled by a solution, Conductor will find what groups a resource belongs to and calculate an effective policy for that resource.</description>

      <description>Conductor is primarily aimed at cloud enabled enterprises with complicated operational methodologies and requirements. This however does not preclude SME&amp;rsquo;s from using Conductor, in fact many smaller organisations can benefit from our free tier plan to get started. Additionally, Conductor is able to be used by managed service providers who may manage multiple other organisations, there are several ways of achieving this effectively, so please get in touch.</description>

      <description>Conductor uses a pay-per-provisioned GB model due to the ease of estimating costs to users and because it is able to be directly correlated to value for customers. Solutions offered as global via the included solution gallery will remain free, however this does not prevent third-party or even additional solutions from being offered on a paid-for basis in the future.</description>

      <description>Conductor has lean requirements for getting started, namely the following two things are needed:
Platform Setup Access to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider account is required to execute Conductor solutions using AWS Lambda. Conductor simply requires an ARN of an AWS IAM Role meeting or exceeding this policy .
   { &#34;Version&#34;: &#34;2012-10-17&#34;, &#34;Statement&#34;: [ { &#34;Action&#34;: [ &#34;iam:CreatePolicy&#34;, &#34;iam:CreateRole&#34;, &#34;iam:AttachRolePolicy&#34; ], &#34;Effect&#34;: &#34;Allow&#34;, &#34;Resource&#34;: &#34;*&#34; } ] }     API Credentials Services or platforms you wish to integrate Conductor with (for example*) must have a public accessible API, and ability to support authentication via HTTPS or AWS Roles.</description>

      <title>resource organisation models</title>

      <description>Conductor has two key concepts which enable organisations to visualise and apply policies to resources flexibly, queries and resource groups. Queries are used to return a collection of resources along a high degree of dimensions, whereas resource groups effectively save these queries into a reusable, logical collection somewhere in your Conductor resource hierarchy. This section outlines some classic approaches to building a resource model to enables your organisation to quickly build a well-defined hierarchy of management and reporting across all integrated services, platforms and resource types.</description>
